This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements, accessibility needs, brand guidelines

## Core Implementation Priorities

When implementing designs, focus on these elements with meticulous attention:

- **Typography**: Never settle for the obvious choice. Font weight, letter-spacing, and line-height deserve real thought. Create dramatic contrast through scale, weight, and style variations.
- **Color**: Go beyond basic palettes. Explore unexpected combinations, gradients with intention, or almost-black-but-not-quite dark modes. Color should evoke mood.
- **Motion**: One orchestrated moment is worth more than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

## Fonts to AVOID

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families:
- ❌ Inter
- ❌ Roboto
- ❌ Arial
- ❌ System fonts
- ❌ Space Grotesk (overused in AI designs)

Also avoid:
- Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

## Design Philosophy

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:
- Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
- Elegance comes from executing the vision well

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
